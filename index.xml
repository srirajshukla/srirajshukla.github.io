      <description>What is a Double Pendulum? A double pendulum is a pendulum with another pendulum attached to its end, and is a simple physical system that exhibits rich dynamic behavior with a strong sensitivity to initial conditions.
In the next few articles I&amp;rsquo;m going to describe how this motion happens, and how to simulate it using rust and webassembly. Meanwhile, check it out at: https://dpvis.herokuapp.com/

      <title>The Problem with auto_now and auto_now_add in Django.</title>

      <description>auto_now and auto_add_now are attributes to Django DateTimeField methods.
auto_now changes the field to timezone.now whenever the field is saved, auto_now_add on the other hand only updates the field once when it is created.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have created a model like this:
class TimeTest(models.Model): created = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True) updated = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True) Now, for some reasons, you want to update the created field in your model - You Can&amp;rsquo;t.
So you think, what can I do, you do some googling, and find that there&amp;rsquo;s a property called editable.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Gyanendra Shukla. I am studying Computer Science at NIT Bhopal.I&amp;rsquo;m working on Rust and Haskell these days. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in all fields of CS, but most of all OS and compilers.
I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on some simple simulation projects, that I would like to explore further later on. I&amp;rsquo;ve also worked on some small utility tools such as URL shorteners, mini grep tools, etc.
I&amp;rsquo;m also interested in Quantum Computing and would like to work on it.</description>
